**5. Operating Income (EBIT):**

*   EBIT has significantly increased from 181.84 in 2022 to 662.27 in 2029. This demonstrates strong operational efficiency, as the company is generating more profit from its core business activities before considering interest and taxes.

**11. Depreciation and Amortization:**
