### 4. Changes in Working Capital

Increase in Current Assets (e.g., Inventory, Accounts Receivable) → Uses of funds.
Increase in Current Liabilities (e.g., Payables, Short-term Debt) → Sources of funds.

The tool output provides the `Working Capital` delta for each period.

*   **Net Change in Working Capital:** The working capital is negative across all periods, indicating a potential strain on liquidity.

### 5. Fund Flow from Different Activities

| **Activity Type**        | **Net Inflow/Outflow ($)** | **Remarks**                                |

**Note:** The specific amounts for each year can be derived from the `Operating Cash Flow`, `Investing Cash Flow`, and `Financing Cash Flow` from the tool output.

### 6. Liquidity & Financial Stability Assessment

*   **Cash Flow Sufficiency:** The company's operating cash flow is generally positive and increasing, suggesting an improving ability to meet obligations. However, the negative net cash flow in some years warrants attention.
*   **Debt-Equity Ratio Impact:** The decrease in long-term debt improves the debt-equity ratio, indicating reduced financial leverage.
*   **Overall Business Strategy Alignment:** The fund flows appear to support business growth, as evidenced by increasing operating cash flow and liquidity position.

### 7. Key Insights & Recommendations

*   **Positive Trends:** Strong and increasing operating cash inflows, decreasing debt levels, and an improving liquidity position are positive trends.
*   **Risk Factors:** The negative net cash flow in the initial years and negative working capital across all periods are risk factors that need to be addressed.
*   **Strategic Actions:**
    *   Focus on improving working capital management to enhance liquidity.
    *   Continue to reduce debt levels to strengthen the balance sheet.
    *   Monitor net cash flow closely and take corrective actions if it remains negative.
    *   Explore opportunities to optimize capital expenditures and investments to improve overall fund management.
